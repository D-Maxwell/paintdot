# Paint.SEA
##### The first entry to the SEA software array, using the [Crated](https://github.com/D-Maxwell/Crated/) framework for its frontend.


This is not an unofficial port, nor does it have any relation whatsoever to paint.NET, apart from inspiration.

The aforementioned software is a great one in my regard, and as it is unfortunately neither open source nor available on Linux, I am hoping that this tool may satisfy those accustomed to an image editing experience closer to that which it provides on Windows.
